Recently while walking to the shops with my wife and 22 month old son in his buggy, we approached a pedestrian crossing we needed to cross at.

As we approached the crossing my wife noticed that the green man was showing so we&#8217;d be able to cross straight away, however as we got to the lights the man turned red; we&#8217;d have to wait a little while.

&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s turned red&#8221; she said as we got to the kerb.  
&#8220;It&#8217;s OK&#8221; I replied.

At which point she took a step toward the road with the buggy just as the cars started to pull away at the lightsâ€š Talk about heart attack moment!

As my mouth opened to speak she stopped and said, &#8220;I thought you said it was clear?&#8221;

&#8220;Nnnooooo!&#8221; I said &#8211; &#8220;it&#8217;s OK&#8221; as-in it&#8217;s OK that the light went red because we&#8217;re not in a hurry and we can wait, not &#8220;it&#8217;s OK to walk out in front of the moving cars!&#8221;

The consequences of language or terminology assumptions can be horrific; thankfully in this case they weren&#8217;t and good old fashioned self-preservation won the day.

In testing make sure that what you&#8217;re reading or hearing is absolutely accurate and unambiguous before you make any decisions that affect the project; don&#8217;t walk out in front of a car!
