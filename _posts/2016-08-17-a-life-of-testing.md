I've been a professional tester since 2003.

I say I've been a professional tester since 2003 but recently realised that I've had a "tester" mindset for much, much longer than that; In fact as clich√© as it sounds, I've pretty much been a tester my whole life.

So today I thought I'd like to suggest a little game to everyone  See if you can remember _your_ earliest memory of "testing" something.

For me, as far as I can remember it's when I was 9 years old and was bought a Bandai Lazer Tank for Christmas.

I remember unwrapping it and staring in wonderment; what on earth does this thing do?

Within minutes I had questions:

* Will it work on lino?
* What about carpet?
* What about the pile rug? It's a tank after all!  Oh nope; stuck on the rug! In fact, the rug is now churned-up inside the wheel. Whoops!
* Do the pieces pop off in a different sequence each time?
* What if I shoot it through the patio door? Or the mirror? Or my granddad's Ray Bans that I'm specifically forbidden from touching?
* How far from the tank can I be, and still get the laser to hit it? That's a great reason to go outside in the cold, to the back of the garden in nothing but pyjamas!

I was obsessed with finding the limitations of the thing!

So for me that's my earliest memory of "testing" and I think a lot of people with testing careers probably have a similar mindset that started WAY before your "profession" as a tester began?

So have a think about your own earliest testing memories and let's get sharing.
