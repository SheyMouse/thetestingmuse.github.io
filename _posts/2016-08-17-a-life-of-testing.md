I&#8217;ve been a professional tester since 2003.

I say I&#8217;ve been a professional tester since 2003 but recently realised that I&#8217;ve had a &#8220;tester&#8221; mindset for much, much longer than that; In fact as cliché as it sounds, I&#8217;ve pretty much been a tester my whole life.

So today I thought I&#8217;d like to suggest a little game to everyone &#8211; See if you can remember _your_ earliest memory of &#8220;testing&#8221; something.

For me, as far as I can remember it&#8217;s when I was 9 years old and was bought a Bandai Lazer Tank for Christmas.

<div class="wp-block-image">
  <figure class="alignright size-large"><img src="https://thetestingmuse.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bc708fa7-4f5c-489d-b6ae-f3998915ef5a-35677-0000194910d387dd.jpg" alt="Lazer Tank by Bandai" class="wp-image-447" /><figcaption>Lazer Tank by Bandai</figcaption></figure>
</div>

I remember unwrapping it and staring in wonderment; what on earth does this thing do?

Within minutes I had questions:

• Will it work on lino?

• What about carpet?

• What about the pile rug? It&#8217;s a tank after all! &#8211; Oh nope; stuck on the rug! In fact, the rug is now churned-up inside the wheel. Whoops!

• Do the pieces pop off in a different sequence each time?

• What if I shoot it through the patio door? Or the mirror? Or my granddad&#8217;s Ray Bans that I&#8217;m specifically forbidden from touching?

• How far from the tank can I be, and still get the laser to hit it? That&#8217;s a great reason to go outside in the cold, to the back of the garden in nothing but pyjamas!

I was obsessed with finding the limitations of the thing!

So for me that&#8217;s my earliest memory of &#8220;testing&#8221; and I think a lot of people with testing careers probably have a similar mindset that started WAY before your &#8220;profession&#8221; as a tester began?

So have a think about your own earliest testing memories and let&#8217;s get sharing.
