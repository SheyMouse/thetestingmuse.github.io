# Let’s lift each other up

On [8th May][1] of this year, the [Ministry of Testing][2] Twitter account tweeted the following:

> Let's lift each other up. The person who helped my career the most...

As there are FAR too many people who have helped my career I couldn’t limit myself to a single person, and in fact I realised that the character limit on Twitter also prevented me from listing the important people, let alone go into detail on the _reason_ I hold them in high esteem.

This blog post is designed to add some clarity to the list of names I tweeted, in addition to adding more people who simply wouldn’t fit in the first tweet. I also have an appalling memory so if you’re not on the list, my apologies. :( 

So without further ado…

James, in a small meeting room in a London Euston hotel, you single-handedly opened my eyes to “testing” in the truest sense of the word. You helped me to understand context, to put labels to some of the types of testing I was doing, and you encouraged me to adopt the handle “The Testing Muse” and to share my experiences. You and the RST course were an awakening for me in my career and I will be forever thankful.

Vern, you’re one of my closest friends, and a stalwart advocate for doing the right thing in the right way. You’ve were instrumental in dragging me up from rock bottom, not only in my career, but my life too and you’ve always been there for me, as a friend and a peer. I find your willingness to help others, your confidence, and your community involvement truly inspiring. Thank you. :)

A few years back you created a conference, which brought excellent people together with a common cause. It’s now grown to the point of helping people worldwide with their careers, with getting started in a testing career, with training, with connections and friendships, with their mental health etc. There’s *so* much excellent work you all do it was a no brainer for me to permanently advertise you wherever I go with a tattoo. You should all be *very* proud of what you do. Thank you.
